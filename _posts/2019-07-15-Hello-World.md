Ok, I think I finally got it this time. I found a theme that I liked, which can be found in [here](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes).

Ideally I will be documenting my emacs config file, environment setup in a windows machine as well as other tools, scripts and useful things that I've learned along the way.

Furthermore, I'd probably want to document other things that I constantly find myself searching and googling every now and then such as how to use registers in emacs, regular expressions in python, searching for specific git commits and cherry picking both in the command line and on emacs. 

Things that I still need to do:

1. Create a placeholder for Tools, Windows Environment, Emacs and Scripts pges.
2. Create a a new category that will be used for links. Kind of like bookmarks.
3. Create categories, tags and sitemap pages.

Anyway, this should be good enough for now.
